## ðŸš€ Key Features of ROCK DeFi

**Perpetual Demand Mechanism**: Fueled by $LiSTX, ROCK's demand is perpetual. Community members can donate as little as 0.000001 $LiSTX to increase the principal! This contract convert $LiSTX to $ROCK, which is then either sent to the NFT Staking Contract or burned, thus driving demand.

You can see the video here on how to send LiSTX to the contract, along with how it works!

**NFT Staking**: Stake NFTs, earn ROCK. Currently, each NFT staked earns 0.01 ROCK per block. This model empowers communities to leverage staking rewards while minimizing circulating supply.
