                                  # ROCK DeFi Ecosystem on Stacks â€“ Open Source Contracts for the Community


Welcome to the ROCK Ecosystem! This collection of smart contracts is designed to bring perpetual demand and a full DeFi ecosystem to any token on the Stacks blockchain. Built with a community-first mindset that incorporates everything good about Bitcoin and Stacks, these contracts create sustainable demand, circular value, and open up decentralized financial operations for your token. With a bit of configuration, they can be adapted to serve a variety of use cases. Let's dive into the contracts and the ecosystem that will power the next phase of #BitcoinDeFi.

## ðŸ“œ Contracts Overview

### 1. **BuyInROCKTestnet & BuyInRockMainnet**
   - **Description:** Enables users to buy NFTs in the token of their choice, especially ROCK, your communityâ€™s memecoin. This contract allows minting in ROCK by swapping it for STX in the background and then minting the NFT. No more minting in just STX from Gamma; use your token to power your NFT minting!
   - **Use Cases:** Useful for any NFT collection that wishes to offer their community the ability to mint using a specific token.

   - Testnet working
   - Still in progress.

### 2. **StakeForROCKMainnet & StakeForRockTestnet**
   - **Description:** These contracts allow you to stake your NFTs and earn rewards in ROCK. The longer you stake, the more rewards you accumulate. It's a simple yet powerful staking platform that can be extended to future collaborations with other communities.
   - **Use Cases:** For communities wishing to offer a staking mechanism for their NFTs that produces linear rewards over time.
   
   - Testnet and Mainnet working

### 3. **SendLiSAMainnet & SendLiSATestnet**
   - **Description:** SendLiSA is a self-monitored and maintained vault for LiSTX. It acts as a one-way funnel into ROCK, periodically allowing a small percentage of LiSTX to be swapped into ROCK. This drives perpetual demand by funneling these funds into further parts of the ecosystem like SwapForStakeNBurn.
   - **Use Cases:** This contract can be used to maintain perpetual demand for your token by consistently converting assets into ROCK (or another token of your choice) for further use within the ecosystem.

   - Testnet and Mainnet working

### 4. **SwapForStakeNBurnMainnet & SwapForStakeNBurnTestnet**
   - **Description:** A contract that allows anyone to swap LiSTX into ROCK, then either burns the ROCK or sends it to the StakeForROCK contract. This serves as a decentralized, perpetual demand mechanism to keep ROCK scarce and valuable.
   - **Use Cases:** Ideal for community tokens to create ongoing buy pressure, reduce circulating supply, or drive staking pools.

   - Testnet and Mainnet working

### 5. **Lending**
   - **Description:** A temporary lending protocol based on Hiro's sample code, which provides a foundation for building out decentralized finance features. This contract can be expanded for DeFi use cases specific to your community's memecoin.
   - Currently more of a placeholder, but can be expanded into a full lending solution for community tokens.

## ðŸš€ How it Works: The ROCK Ecosystem Flow

1. **Mint in ROCK:** BuyInROCK allows your community to mint NFTs using ROCK or any other memecoin. This app works by swapping ROCK for STX in the background to facilitate the minting process.

2. **Perpetual Demand via SendLiSA:** SendLiSA periodically swaps a percentage of LiSTX into ROCK. This ensures continuous demand for ROCK and fuels the entire ecosystem. One way funnel means this LiSTX can only be used to buy more ROCK. LET'S GO BABY.

3. **Swap & Burn:** The SwapForStakeNBurn contract allows anyone to convert the swapped LiSTX into ROCK. This ROCK can either be burned (reducing supply) or sent to the StakeForROCK contract.

4. **Staking:** With StakeForROCK, users can stake their ROCK NFTs and earn rewards. This staking platform can be extended for future collaborations and projects, offering even more utility to the ROCK ecosystem.

5. **Circular Value:** All these contracts work in harmony to create a full, circular DeFi ecosystem that drives value to your token. Itâ€™s open, decentralized, and configurable to suit various needs. It allows some gamification and competition, along with a natural mechanism of buying power being leveraged. HARD. At the base layer of LiSTX is the Bitcoin rewards from Stacks' stacking protocol. So it really is Bitcoin and Stack's ethos taking fruit.

Stacks leverages Bitcoin, and ROCK leverages Stacks' leveraging Bitcoin.

This is the way.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Open Source & Community-Driven?

These contracts were built with the community in mind. By launching this as open-source, anyone can adapt these contracts for their own projects. The idea is to promote perpetual demand for your token, offer sustainable financial operations, and provide tools to build a complete DeFi ecosystem on Stacks.

### Why This Matters:
- **Perpetual Demand:** The contracts create a constant buy pressure on your token, driving its value up over time.
- **Circular Ecosystem:** Allows communities to create a self-sustaining DeFi ecosystem including staking, burning, swapping, and more.
- **Low Barriers for Non-Devs:** These contracts are ready to deploy and use, requiring minimal configuration to fit your specific use case.

### Donations & Community Support
All these contracts are released to help the community, no fees, no private alpha. If you find these contracts valuable, consider donating to Highroller.btc. Your support will help maintain this ecosystem and fuel future development for the benefit of the entire community.
