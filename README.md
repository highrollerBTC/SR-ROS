## ðŸš€ Key Features of ROCK DeFi

**Perpetual Demand Mechanism**: Fueled by $LiSTX, ROCK's demand is perpetual. Community members can donate as little as 0.000001 $LiSTX to keep the cycle going. Funds convert $LiSTX to $ROCK, which is then either staked or burnedâ€”automatically driving demand.

**NFT Staking**: Stake NFTs, earn ROCK. Currently, each NFT staked earns 0.01 ROCK per block. This model empowers communities to leverage staking rewards while minimizing circulating supply.

## ðŸ’¡ Why ROCK DeFi?

- **Perpetual Demand & Utility**: With every swap and burn, ROCK gains a stable demand foundation. $ROCK utility will continue to expand in Phase 2, with new use cases on the way.
- **Self-Sustaining Ecosystem**: Donations power ROCK, creating lasting demand.
- **Community Focused**: Built for and powered by the community, anyone can participate by sending $LiSTX to grow ROCK.
